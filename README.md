**logic-simulator**
the simple simulator computes the outputs of circuits containing NOT, OR and AND gates as well as D-flip-flops. Each computation is executed in one tact.

This implementation is part of an academical assignment where the api and the test script are provided by the host "gitlab.uni-hannover.de".

Clone the repository, then type ./test.bash to run the program on all circuit examples.
